### 🧪 Day 16: Aunt Sue

You’ve received a mysterious gift from “Aunt Sue” — but with 500 Aunt Sues on record, you’ll need to do some sleuthing to find the real one. Luckily, the present included a **My First Crime Scene Analysis Machine**, which reveals the exact chemical makeup of the gift’s wrapping paper.

Using a list of what each Aunt Sue is known to possess — from **cats** to **perfumes** — you compare the machine’s report to narrow down the suspects. Only one Aunt's data matches the gift's compound readout exactly.

But before you mail the thank you note, you discover a quirk in the machine: some traits are approximate. **Cats** and **trees** should be *greater than* the report, while **pomeranians** and **goldfish** must be *fewer than* the given values. With those adjustments, you pinpoint the true gift-giver — the one and only Aunt Sue #241.
