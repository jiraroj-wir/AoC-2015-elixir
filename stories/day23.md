### ðŸ’¾ Day 23: Opening the Turing Lock

Little Jane Marie just unwrapped her first **computer**, complete with a curious program and a set of minimalist instructions. The machine has only **two registers**, `a` and `b`, and supports basic operations like **increment**, **halve**, **triple**, and a few types of conditional **jumps**.

You simulate the program line-by-line, watching how it manipulates the registers based on jump conditions and arithmetic logic. Starting with both registers at zero, your goal is to determine the final value in register `b`.

In part two, the twist is simple but significant â€” **register `a` starts at 1** instead. This small change reroutes the programâ€™s logic, leading to a very different outcome. Sometimes, the smallest switches make the biggest difference in code.
