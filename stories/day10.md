### 🗣️ Day 10: Elves Look, Elves Say

The Elves have gathered for a festive logic game: **look-and-say**. It starts with a number, and each turn they describe the previous sequence aloud — "one 1", "two 1s", "one 2, one 1", and so on — turning it into a new sequence of digits.

From humble beginnings, the sequence quickly grows into something massive. Starting with a short number, they repeat this process 40 times, transforming the string through iteration after iteration of verbal transformation.

But the game doesn’t stop there. Pushing the boundaries of patience (and memory), the Elves try it 50 times — just to see how far the sequence can go. What begins as a simple chant becomes a sprawling numeric tale, told one digit at a time.

Elven entertainment, as it turns out, is anything but short-winded.
