### ðŸ”¤ Day 8: Matchsticks

With space on the sleigh at a premium, Santa decides to go paperless â€” uploading his list as a digital file filled with string literals. But there's a catch: he needs to calculate exactly how much space the data will consume.

Each string is written using programming-style escape sequences â€” with backslashes, quotes, and hexadecimal character codes all increasing the codeâ€™s length compared to what is actually stored in memory. The difference between code length and in-memory representation becomes surprisingly significant when multiplied across thousands of names.

Later, Santa flips the problem: instead of measuring stored size, he needs to *encode* each string again, escaping it for safe transport. Suddenly, the digital list grows even larger, and sleigh-packing logistics turn into a problem of character accounting.

Matchsticks may be old-school, but in the age of code, every byte still counts.
