### 🎁 Day 2: I Was Told There Would Be No Math

With Christmas approaching fast, the elves are scrambling to wrap an enormous pile of gifts — but their supply of wrapping paper is running dangerously low. Each gift is a neat rectangular box, and the elves must calculate the precise surface area to order just enough paper, plus a little extra for safety (no one likes a gift with corners poking through).

But wrapping paper isn’t the only thing running short. The elves also need to order ribbon — not just to wrap the presents, but to craft perfect bows on top. For each box, they measure the smallest perimeter for the ribbon wrap, and add enough length to match the box’s volume for the bow. As always, they refuse to share how the bow-tying magic works.

With spreadsheets full of dimensions and tight logistics, it’s a race to measure, cut, and wrap — the elven way.
