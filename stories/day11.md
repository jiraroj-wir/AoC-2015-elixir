### 🔐 Day 11: Corporate Policy

Santa's password has expired — again. To keep things secure (and overly complicated), the North Pole’s new Security-Elf has rolled out a strict set of password rules.

Every password must be exactly eight lowercase letters, and finding a new one means incrementing the old password like an odometer, letter by letter. But that's not all: the new rules require at least one sequence of three consecutive increasing letters (like `abc`), prohibit confusing letters like `i`, `o`, and `l`, and demand at least two different, non-overlapping pairs of identical letters.

What started as a simple password reset turns into an exercise in elvish bureaucracy, as Santa carefully tiptoes through the minefield of rules to find a password that’s both secure and compliant — only to have it expire again shortly after.
