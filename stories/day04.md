### ðŸ’° Day 4: The Ideal Stocking Stuffer

Santa's gone digital. To reward the most economically savvy children, he's decided to distribute a new kind of gift: **AdventCoins**, a festive cryptocurrency.

But mining these coins isnâ€™t easy. Each AdventCoin is verified by finding a number which, when combined with a secret key and hashed using MD5, produces a hash that starts with a specific number of zeroes. At first, five zeroes are enough â€” but soon the standard rises to six, requiring even more computational effort.

Santa turns to brute force, hashing countless combinations until he uncovers the magical numbers. In a season of toys and tradition, it seems even the North Pole is embracing the blockchain.
