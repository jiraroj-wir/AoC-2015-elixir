### 🍪 Day 15: Science for Hungry People

Santa's cookie lab is in full swing, and today you're tweaking your recipe to perfection. With exactly 100 teaspoons to divide, you must mix the ideal ratio of ingredients — each with unique traits like **capacity**, **durability**, **flavor**, **texture**, and **calories** — to create the ultimate milk-dunking treat.

The goal is to maximize your cookie’s score by summing each property (ignoring calories), clamping negatives to zero, and multiplying the results. It’s a tricky optimization puzzle, trying every possible combination to find the tastiest outcome.

Then comes a new challenge: remake the recipe, but this time with *exactly 500 calories*. The calorie constraint makes good combinations much rarer — but still possible. In this sugar-fueled quest for perfection, it’s not just about taste, but also *balance*.
