### 🛡️ Day 21: RPG Simulator 20XX

Little Henry Case is stuck on a boss in his new Christmas RPG, and hands you the controller. The game pits you against a boss in a **turn-based duel**, where stats like **damage** and **armor** determine how quickly each character falls. You always attack first, and each blow deals at least 1 damage.

You’re free to shop for gear with unlimited gold — but only one weapon, optionally one piece of armor, and up to two rings. Your goal is to find the **cheapest set of items** that lets you defeat the boss, factoring in every possible loadout.

In part two, the challenge flips: what’s the **most gold** you can waste on gear and still lose the fight? With dozens of combinations and tight stat margins, this is a duel of min-maxing — and buyer’s remorse.
