### ⚖️ Day 24: It Hangs in the Balance

It’s Christmas Eve, and Santa’s sleigh won’t fly unless perfectly **balanced**. All the packages must be split into **three groups of equal weight**, and Santa wants the **first group** — the one riding up front — to be as small as possible to leave room for his legs.

If multiple groupings use the same number of packages, you choose the one with the **lowest quantum entanglement** — the product of the package weights — to reduce magical instability.

In part two, Santa realizes he forgot the **trunk**, so now the packages must be divided into **four equal groups**. The same rules apply: fewest packages up front, lowest entanglement wins. Turns out holiday logistics are a delicate balancing act — in every sense.
