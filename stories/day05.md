### ✉️ Day 5: Doesn't He Have Intern-Elves For This?

As the holiday rush picks up, Santa delegates a tedious task to you: reading through a giant text file of strings to determine which ones are *naughty* and which are *nice*. The criteria are oddly specific — nice strings need a certain number of vowels, repeated letters, and must avoid forbidden sequences. It’s as if the rules were made by committee.

But soon, Santa realizes the system is flawed. He scraps the old guidelines and introduces a new set — one that looks for repeating pairs and patterns with letters repeating around a middle character. The elves, naturally, remain uninformed about the logic behind these shifts.

With the string-checking duties in full swing, you can’t help but wonder: shouldn’t this be an intern-elf’s job?
