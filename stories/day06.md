### ðŸ’¡ Day 6: Probably a Fire Hazard

Tired of losing the neighborhood holiday decorating contest, you go all out this year â€” installing **one million lights** in a massive 1000x1000 grid. Determined to win, you follow a precise set of lighting instructions Santa kindly mailed from the North Pole.

Each command tells you to turn on, turn off, or toggle sections of the grid. As lights flicker to life in dazzling patterns, your competitive spirit soars. But then, a misreading of Santaâ€™s Ancient Nordic Elvish reveals an error: the lights actually support *brightness levels*, not just on and off.

Now you must rework the entire display â€” this time, adjusting brightness values with care. Whether subtly glowing or blazing bright, the light show is sure to leave your neighbors speechless... or possibly blind.

But hey, thatâ€™s victory.
