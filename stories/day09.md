### ðŸ›· Day 9: All in a Single Night

Santa has always delivered presents with astonishing speed â€” all in a single night. But this year, heâ€™s been handed a more complicated route: a set of destinations with known distances between every pair.

To accomplish his mission, Santa must determine the most efficient route that visits **each location exactly once**. He can start and end anywhere, but the goal is to minimize total travel distance. As he crunches the permutations, the optimal path emerges â€” the shortest possible journey through a festive web of cities.

But the following year, Santa raises the stakes. Efficiency? Bah! This time, he chooses the *longest* possible route that still visits each destination once. After all, sometimes itâ€™s about the joy of the journey â€” especially when you have magic reindeer and all night to fly.
