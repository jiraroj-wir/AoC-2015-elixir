### ðŸ§™ Day 22: Wizard Simulator 20XX

Henryâ€™s tired of swords and armor â€” now heâ€™s a **wizard**, slinging spells in turn-based combat against a tough boss. You have 50 hit points, 500 mana, and a handful of spells with effects like **direct damage**, **healing**, **armor boosts**, **poison**, and **mana regeneration**.

Each spell has a mana cost, and some apply effects over multiple turns. You must manage resources carefully: track ongoing effects, avoid overlapping spell durations, and choose a castable spell every turn â€” or lose. Your goal is to **spend the least mana possible** and still win.

In part two, **Hard Mode** kicks in: you lose 1 hit point *every* turn before taking action. The strategy gets even tighter â€” balancing defense, recovery, and burst damage is the only path to magical victory.
