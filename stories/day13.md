### 🍽️ Day 13: Knights of the Dinner Table

Holiday dinners have always been tense — mismatched personalities, awkward conversations, and passive-aggressive pie slices. This year, you decide to take control by **strategically arranging the seating** to maximize happiness around the table.

Each guest has strong feelings — both positive and negative — about sitting next to others, and you've compiled these into a detailed chart. With a circular table, every person has exactly two neighbors, and finding the perfect configuration becomes a puzzle of permutations and emotional arithmetic.

But just when you’ve solved it... you realize you forgot to include **yourself**. Being neutral in all interactions, your presence neither adds nor subtracts from the total happiness. Still, you reshuffle everyone to make space — because even peacekeepers deserve a seat at the table.

This time, maybe dinner won’t end with someone storming off.
