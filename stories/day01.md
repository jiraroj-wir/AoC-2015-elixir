### ðŸŽ„ Day 1: Not Quite Lisp

Santa is gearing up for Christmas, but there's a problem â€” his snow-generating weather machine runs on stars, and he's completely out! To bring back the snow and save Christmas, he needs help collecting fifty stars.

On the first leg of his journey, Santa finds himself lost in a massive, seemingly endless apartment building. To reach the right floor, he follows a peculiar set of directions made entirely of parentheses. An opening parenthesis `(` sends him up a floor, and a closing one `)` brings him down.

He begins his navigation from the ground floor, making his way through mysterious staircases. But as the steps continue, Santa realizes the building even has a basement â€” and soon he must track the exact moment he first descends into it.

Itâ€™s the start of a long quest, one floor at a time.
