### ðŸ§¬ Day 19: Medicine for Rudolph

Rudolphâ€™s nose is dim, and he needs a custom dose of **Red-Nosed Reindeer medicine**. To help, you calibrate a molecular machine that builds complex compounds through a set of replacement rules â€” each swap transforming part of the molecule into something new.

In part one, you start with a base molecule and count how many **distinct molecules** can be produced after a single replacement step. The challenge is parsing all valid transformations without duplicating results.

Once calibrated, it's time to synthesize the medicine â€” starting from a single **electron (`e`)**. Using the same replacement rules in reverse, your task is to **build the target molecule in as few steps as possible**. Chemistry, it turns out, can be a real puzzle.
