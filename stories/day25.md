### ❄️ Day 25: Let It Snow

It’s Christmas morning, and Santa is ready to **boot up the weather machine** for a white Christmas — but there’s a catch. The console demands a **code from the manual**, which is nowhere to be found. After a call to the long-defunct support line (and a hold tune you won’t soon forget), you learn how to derive the code.

The codes are arranged in a **diagonal pattern** across an infinite grid, starting at 20151125 and calculated by repeatedly multiplying by 252533 and taking the result modulo 33554393. You trace the pattern to find the **position of your target row and column**, and iterate through the formula until you arrive at the correct code.

But after entering it, the machine halts again: only **one star is available**, and it demands fifty. You glance at your completed Advent calendar — each puzzle solved, every challenge met. You feed the final star into the console... and the machine hums to life.

Outside, the first snowflakes begin to fall.

*Congratulations — you’ve brought the snow, and completed Advent of Code 2015.*
