## ❄️ Year Summary

Santa’s 2015 quest begins in a mysterious apartment building and stretches through logic puzzles, reindeer races, and holiday magic. 
With your help, he navigates circuits, plays with molecular chemistry, balances sleigh loads, and even defeats RPG bosses — all to gather 50 stars and bring snow to Christmas morning.

Each puzzle solved brought him one step closer to his goal. And in the end, with the weather machine humming and the snow gently falling, you saved Christmas.

🎉 *Congratulations — you’ve completed Advent of Code 2015.*
