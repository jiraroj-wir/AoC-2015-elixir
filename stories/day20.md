### 🎁 Day 20: Infinite Elves and Infinite Houses

To keep the Elves busy, Santa sends them out delivering presents down an **infinite row of houses**, where each Elf visits homes based on their own number — Elf #1 visits every house, Elf #2 every second house, and so on.

Each Elf drops off **10 times their number** of presents at every house they visit. Your goal is to find the **lowest house number** that receives at least as many presents as the target number in your puzzle input.

Then, the Elves get picky. In part two, each Elf decides to visit **only 50 houses**, but they boost their delivery to **11 times their number** per house. With this new rule in place, you run the numbers again to find the new lowest house that meets the quota. Even with infinite Elves, efficiency matters.
