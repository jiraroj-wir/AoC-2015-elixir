### ðŸ”Œ Day 7: Some Assembly Required

Santa gifts little Bobby Tables a do-it-yourself electronics kit filled with wires, gates, and logic â€” a dream for any aspiring young engineer. The kit supports 16-bit signals and includes operations like AND, OR, LSHIFT, RSHIFT, and NOT, all wired together to form a digital circuit.

Unfortunately, Bobby is a bit young to understand the finer points of signal propagation, so itâ€™s up to you to interpret the instruction manual and determine the final value on each wire. The task quickly turns into a tangled puzzle of dependencies, where each wireâ€™s value relies on the proper resolution of many others.

After solving the circuit, a twist appears: Santa wants you to override one wire and rerun the entire configuration. The simple toy kit reveals itself to be a surprisingly intricate challenge in digital logic â€” and Bobby just wants to know when it will start blinking.
