### ðŸ¦Œ Day 14: Reindeer Olympics

Itâ€™s the most wonderful time of the year â€” the **Reindeer Olympics** are underway! Santa's elite team of flying reindeer are competing in an epic endurance race, testing both their speed and stamina.

Each reindeer has a unique rhythm: a burst of high-speed flight followed by a mandatory rest. The race runs for exactly 2503 seconds, and Santa wants to know which reindeer travels the farthest. With each one alternating between flying and resting, tracking their positions over time becomes a battle of bursts and patience.

But distance isnâ€™t everything. In a twist, Santa introduces a new scoring system: each second, the reindeer currently in the lead earns a point. Now, consistency and timing matter as much as raw speed. 

In this festive clash of strategy and strength, itâ€™s not just about who flies the fastest â€” but who flies *smartest*.
