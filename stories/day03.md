### üè† Day 3: Perfectly Spherical Houses in a Vacuum

Santa sets out to deliver presents across an infinite two-dimensional grid of houses. Starting at a single home, he follows a stream of directional commands‚Äînorth, south, east, west‚Äîdelivering a gift at each new location he visits.

But the directions, radioed in by a rather tipsy elf from the North Pole, lead Santa to revisit some houses more than once. As a result, some lucky children get extra gifts while others wait their turn.

The following year, to improve delivery efficiency, Santa builds a mechanical helper: Robo-Santa. Together, they alternate moves across the grid, both starting from the same house. With two sets of boots padding across the snow, the reach of gift-giving expands ‚Äî though the coordination leaves much to be desired.

Even in a vacuum filled with perfectly spaced homes, holiday logistics remain far from simple.
