### ðŸ“Š Day 12: JSAbacusFramework.io

The Accounting-Elves are trying to settle the books, but their records are stored in a quirky JSON format courtesy of a software package called **JSAbacusFramework.io**. Your job? Traverse the tangled mix of arrays, objects, and numbers to calculate the grand total hidden within.

At first, the task is simple: find every number and sum them all. But then a problem arises â€” someone noticed that anything marked `"red"` should be excluded from the accounting. Suddenly, entire sections of the data must be ignored if they're tainted by that single scarlet word â€” but only when it appears in objects, not arrays.

What began as basic bookkeeping becomes a minefield of edge cases, JSON quirks, and strict elf accounting standards. As always, precision is everything when you're dealing with holiday budgets.
